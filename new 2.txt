1) Stuff in intro not updated
2) NAB to host MX during co-existence (whole way)
3) Exchange Archiving? 5GB mailbox limit.... then what?
4) DLP for email?
5) As discussed, would like a proforma Sharepoint Site design (permissions etc.)
6) 5.6 and 5.7 should be merged
7) One Drive - different experience prior to data migration
8) 5.8.1 - want single sign on experience.
9) p119 details on Polycom and Evoko federation very light - this is a promise more than a design.
10) p85 federation with NAB for IM?
11) p121 location based AD structure was dropped
12) p123 computer naming standards don't cater for non-7 digit serials
13) p124 computer and user GPOs very light. No regional settings, settings for Cortana, security controls for standard users etc.
14) p131 confirm Okta intergration already established by H&I
15) p134 confirm FIM already activated
16) p175 reference to patching cycle section "3.2.5.3.6" - this is not a real section.
17) p184 map layers to numbers
18) SCCM only refers to Win10 SOE. Need Win 7 SOE too (but mention TBD what hardware this will be rolled out to prior to creation)
19) p187 Windows SOE should be as bare as possible and all apps deployed as L2.
20) p187 Office needs to be C2R versions.
21) p192 Talks of customisations that should be in the GPO section.
22) p197 the split partitions sound like a recipe for user disaster. Can we just have a single 256GB partition?
23) p198 again, GPOs distributed - can we just reference all of these as an appendix.
24) p201 need to add SafeBoot
25) 

General:

1) Firewall rules included for some components (SCCM) not others (S4B)
2) Service now inte
3) No mention of AppDNA testing
4) How will BIOS updates be handled?
